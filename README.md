# Mini To Do App
My computer broke, so I have to put game dev on hold </3, so with the power of my backup pc, I've now dived into the scary yet amazing world of app development - mostly Android development with Java. I made this little to do application from the Full Android 11 Masterclass Course by Oak Academy. This application allows a user to add a task, and remove a task, as well as view their tasks which are stored for future use (so they can leave the app without losing their tasks).
